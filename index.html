        congestion pricing on January 5.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The city began tolling vehicles that cross through New York's central
        business district, or what the transit authority calls the "Congestion
        Relief Zone." The area is bounded by 60th St. to the north and the Hugh L.
        Carey Tunnel to the south.

        Vehicles pay
        <a href="https://new.mta.info/document/138931">different</a> rates
        depending on the time of day and type of vehicle. For example, taxis or
        for-hire-vehicles (think Uber, Lyft, etc.) pay between $0.75 and $1.50 per
        trip, whereas passenger vehicles pay a one time entry charge between $3.50
        and $13.50 according to the transit authority.

      <p>
        Congestion pricing has the potential to reduce traffic, reducing travel
        times and

          even fuel emissions</a
        >.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        However, it also has the potential to make roads less accessible. The
        plan's potential economic consequences were part of why New York Gov.

        the first iteration of the congestion pricing plan, set to begin in June
        2024. The current pricing plan does
        <a href="https://congestionreliefzone.mta.info/tolling">offer</a> a
        variety of discounts and exemptions for some traveling through the tolled
        area &mdash; for example, the transit authority offers a discount plan for
        low-income drivers.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Passing this tolling policy was a difficult road and remains contentious

          href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-jersey-mayor-floats-reverse-congestion-pricing-toll-response-nycs-controversial-toll"
          >reported</a
        >
        that New Jersey mayor Steven Fulop has proposed the idea for a reverse
        congestion toll.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Ultimately, though, congestion tolls may very well take off in the future,
        offering a more sustainable and efficient source of revenue for public
        transit and roadway authorities, while also encouraging more sustainable
        forms of transportation like cycling or walking.
